## Welcome!

If you are interested in harmful algal bloom formation in the subarctic Canadian lakes this is the place for you! My name is Daniela Klicper, I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Geography at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, CA. I currently reside on the shores of Lake Huron in the Town of Goderich, ON, CA. 

## Proposed PhD research: Harmful Algal Bloom Formation in subarctic Jackfish Lake, Northwest Territories 

The impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on water quality in the subarctic Canadian lakes are a relatively new topic of concern as these landscapes experience historical and current anthropogenic impacts coupled with a changing climate. Jackfish Lake, in the city of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories (NWT) is one such area where these blooms have increased in frequency since 2013. Currently, Jackfish Lake is dominated by Plantktothrix, a toxin producing cyanobacteria which can be associated with the production of microcyctin, and anatoxin-a known to have potentially lethal effects on humans and wildlife. The proposed research will help determine the sequence of chemical, physical and biological conditions that lead to blooms in Jackfish Lake. Secondly, it will be important to quantify the current toxin risk in the lake, and if the Planktothrix are the only taxa of concern. 

This study will build on understanding key factors in algae bloom formation in other areas in Canada and beyond laying ground for potential further work towards mitigation of this potentially dangerous phenomena. Biogeochemical cycling, and specifically nutrients such as Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) have been identified as one of the seven planetary boundaries. The scientists proposed quantitative planetary boundaries within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive for generations to come. 

## Research Background

Daniela most recently completed her Master’s degree in Water Security from the University of Saskatchewan, where she studied wetland drainage and its impacts on phosphorus loading into surface water. She also holds a Bachelor of Honours in Environmental and Resource Science from Trent University. With 6 years of professional experience in water and natural resources management, biodiversity conservation and stewardship, Daniela gained excellent leadership, project development and management skills to lead, coordinate, and deliver multiple projects and initiatives. She co-led a major research project titled the Coastal Action Plan for the southeastern shores of Lake Huron. This involved using an ecosystem based approach to measure the state and health of ecosystems along the Sarnia-Tobermory coastline. This involved research and writing of a technical document, while coordinating a steering committee with representation from local Conservation Authorities, Provincial and Federal Government, First Nation and Metis communities and NGO’s.

## Why water quality research?

My passion for water quality stems from growing up, living, and working in and around water (in-land lakes, the Great Lakes, rivers). I am interested in pursuing further knowledge and research in the field of limnology, specifically how nutrient dynamics and lake structure play a role in the development of HAB’s. My research interests align with the FORMBLOOM project. I am particularly interested in working in a co-supervised environment with professors Jason Venkiteswaran and Helen Baulch as part of this project. I was drawn to this project due to its multi-university and multidisciplinary research team, the opportunity to interact with partner organizations and ecosystem managers. I value the input from non-academic organizations as in my experience it can strengthen the outcomes of the research. It would be particularly important during the cyano-HAB forecasting and mitigation efforts.
